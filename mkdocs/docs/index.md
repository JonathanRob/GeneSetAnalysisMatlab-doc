# Gene Set Analysis Matlab (GSAM)

![logo](img/logo.png)

Gene set analysis (GSA) and visualization of results. This package was inspired by (and based on) the [Piano package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/piano.html) for R, which I highly recommend.

## Main functions

* `geneSetAnalysis` - Run a gene set analysis (GSA).
* `importGSC` - Import gene set collection (GSC) from a [.gmt](https://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/gsea/wiki/index.php/Data_formats#GMT:_Gene_Matrix_Transposed_file_format_.28.2A.gmt.29) file.
* `extractMetaboliteGSC` - Extract metabolite gene sets from a genome-scale model.
* `extractSubsystemGSC` - Extract subsystem gene sets from a genome-scale model.
